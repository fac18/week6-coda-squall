## Project
This week's project will involve setting up a database which you connect to via a node.js server. You'll use your data to make a dynamic web app for your front-end.

Some suggested project ideas are below. Feel free to modify according to your interest, provided your idea has similar functionality.

### Requirements

- Simple web app with a node server and a database
- Your database comes with a schema, which should be documented in your readme (along with any other architectural decisions)
- Database hosted on Heroku, or locally
- Build script for your database
- Security concerns appropriately considered (you must protect against script injections!)
- Content dynamic, but DOM manipulation kept to a minimum
- Mobile-first design
- Clear user journey (even if you take one of our suggested ideas, document the user journey in your readme)
- test your server routes with supertest
- test your pure functions both server and client side
- set up a test database so that you can test your database queries
